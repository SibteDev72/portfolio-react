                    Hey. I am Sibte, nice to meet you. Please take a look arround.

                <div>
                    <p>I'm a passionate Web Developer with a strong focus on Front-End development. Over the past months, 
                        I've worked extensively with modern JavaScript frameworks such as React.js, Next.js, Vue.js, and Nuxt.js, 
                        crafting responsive and user-friendly interfaces.In addition to my front-end expertise, I also have hands-on 
                        experience with Node.js and MongoDB, enabling me to build and understand full-stack applications.
                        Iâ€™ve also worked with headless CMS platforms like WordPress, integrating dynamic content with modern 
                        frameworks for flexible and scalable web solutions. Write clean, efficient, and maintainable 
                        code following best practices and coding standards. Good understanding of code 
                        versioning tools, such as Git.
